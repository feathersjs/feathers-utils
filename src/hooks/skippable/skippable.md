## Predicates

`skippable` is a utility function that wraps a hook to make it skippable based on a passed predicate. This is useful when you want to conditionally skip the execution of a hook based on certain criteria, such as the presence of a specific parameter in the context.

'feathers-utils' provides a set of predicates that can be used with this utility.
